avoid branching statement as last in loop
----------

Summary: Name: avoid branching statement as last in loop
<p>Having branching statement as the last statement inside a loop is very confusing, and could largely be forgetting of something and turning into a bug.</p>
<p>This rule is defined by the following class: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/oclint/oclint/blob/master/oclint-rules/rules/convention/AvoidBranchingStatementAsLastInLoopRule.cpp">oclint-rules/rules/convention/AvoidBranchingStatementAsLastInLoopRule.cpp</a></p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre>void example()
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        if (foo(i))
        {
            continue;
        }
        break;      // this break is confusing
    }
}</pre>

bitwise operator in conditional
----------

Summary: Name: bitwise operator in conditional
<p>Checks for bitwise operations in conditionals. Although being written on purpose in some rare cases, bitwise operations are considered to be too “smart”. Smart code is not easy to understand.</p>
<p>This rule is defined by the following class: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/oclint/oclint/blob/master/oclint-rules/rules/basic/BitwiseOperatorInConditionalRule.cpp">oclint-rules/rules/basic/BitwiseOperatorInConditionalRule.cpp</a></p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre>void example(int a, int b)
{
    if (a | b)
    {
    }
    if (a & b)
    {
    }
}</pre>
